# Active_Recall_Pro (This is a stand-in name)
 A flashcard web app project.
## OVERVIEW:
Active Recall Pro (ARP) is a flash card web application that allows users to create a user account, log in, create multimedia flash cards, edit flash cards, delete flash cards, and study flash cards. Future features will include:

* A social media feature that will allow users to make decks public (so that they may be seen and studied by other users) or private (so that only the creator can see the deck and its cards). 
* A version control feature similar to Git for flashcard decks. This would allow users to copy a public deck to their profile and modify it, or to collaborate on decks using a Git-like branch structure. 
* Stat tracking on who creates popular decks (meaning decks that are studied, copied, and branched often) will allow a ranking or reward system to benefit power-users. 
* Features such as a heat map for studying similar to anki or GitHub, and time view (a view of a deck arranged for studying based on the week of a class one is in) are also possible. 
* An integrate AI using an LLM to read all of the cards in a user's FC database and process the results of their studying. The AI will then make suggesstions for what new cards to make, can change the order of what cards to study next, and articulate the user's strengths and weaknesses to display to the user. 
* Most importantly, users will evevntually own their cards and they will be saved to the userâ€™s machine to be synced to the site later.

This is also a learning project for me to get used to a GIT workflow and creating documentation like this.

Note that this code was HEAVILY commented as I am using it as a learning tool and hope to colaborate on later features, but I am moving that information over to the wiki to clean up the code.

    - Create branch
    - Add card list and card create route in views.py (this is one page)

## CONTRIBUTOR INSTRUCTIONS
### I like using GitHub deskptop so these instructions reflect that. You do not have to.
- This is a good overview of GitHub desktop I suggest watching first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE
- An short GitHub tutorial (Skip to 1:35) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CML6vfKjQss
- A more detailed tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSjyU2vf6Y

1. Be sure to have a GitHub profile.
2. Download and install GitHub desktop.
3. Go to the ARP project page and click the "fork" button.
4. Pick yourself as the owner and click "create fork". You should now have your own copy of the project on GitHub. 
5. Open GitHub desktop. Be sure to be signed in.
6. Click the clone button on your version of the project on GitHub and copy the URL.
7. In Github desktop, click "file -> clone repository", paste in the project URL, and select the location to which you will save the repository. The files for the project should now be on your machine and in a local repository. https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop
8. Create a branch on your repository. 
9. To open a dev server version of the project, open "main.py" and run it. It should produce a clickable localhost link in the output. Click on this to open ARP in a browser window.
10. Make your code changes.
11. Add, push, and merge your code. This will all be on your copy of the project.
12. When finished, submit a pull request on GitHub.
13. Respond to feedback on the pull request.
